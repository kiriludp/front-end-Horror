## Web Application Description

A Choose-Your-Own-Adventure style Horror Survival game where you are in charge of your own escape from a classic slasher villian. Players are able to navigate through a series of choices and reach various endings of Survival or Death. The decision tree is in depth, replayable, and a little funny. Filled with the horror tropes we all know and love/get very frustrated with. The design is responsive for all devices and screen sizes and includes alternate text for screen-readers.

  The choice is yours-- How will you survive?
